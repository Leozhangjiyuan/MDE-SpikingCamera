## Dataset

In this work, we propose two datasets. The description are as followed: 

### Synthetic Dataset: *DENSE-Spike*

The Synthetic spike dataset named "DENSE-Spike" is generated based on the [DENSE](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/E2DEPTH.html) dataset using the method described in our paper. The spike data is available and you can download them at [https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Lg2spMW4OYlsYy0iT4u_7g](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Lg2spMW4OYlsYy0iT4u_7g) with the password **1008**.

### Real Dataset: *Outdoor-Spike*

The Real Dataset named "Ourdoor-Spike" contains 33 sequences of outdoor scenes are captured in a driving car from the first perspective. Each
sequence contains 20000 spike frames. The spike data is available and you can download them at [https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hji5GnFH5Ke_nDt-1Q76rg](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hji5GnFH5Ke_nDt-1Q76rg) with the password **1997**.
